Hi! I'm Dustin, a computer science and design student at Northeastern University. I have a passion for computer science, cooking, and taekwondo.

## Programming

At the moment, I am completely enamored with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and actively working on a iOS application in my free time. Over time I've transitioned from wanting to know everything about computer science and attempting to learn as many languages as possible. Now, I'm most interested in what I believe is best referred to as _ergonomic performance_. That is, languages, concepts, frameworks, etc. that have been designed to maximize performance or to design their libraries in such a way that one has to be aware of performance concerns. (i.e. [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon))

## Cooking

TODO.

## Taekwondo

I've been practicing Taekwondo for over 15 years. I'm a 3rd dan black belt in World Taekwondo Federation style Taekwondo.
